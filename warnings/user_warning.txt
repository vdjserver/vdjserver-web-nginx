Hello,

We are detecting a large number of parallel queries against the VDJServer
repository for the AIRR Data Commons, which is causing problems for other
users. Your usage of the API to download large amounts of rearrangement
data is obsolete. There are now quicker and more robust methods to download
large amounts of data, either from the VDJServer website or by using
the async API. Please contact us at vdjserver@utsouthwestern.edu and we
can help you.

thanks
VDJServer Team
